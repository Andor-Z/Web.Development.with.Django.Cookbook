## Introduction

When the database structure is defined in the models, we need some views to let the users enter data or show the data to the people. In this chapter, we will focus on the views managing forms, the list view, and views generating an alternative output than HTML. For the simplest examples, we will leave the creation of URL rules and templates up to you.  

## Passing HttpRequest to the form

The first argument of every Django view is the HttpRequest object that is usually named request. It contains metadata about the request. For example, current language code, current user, current cookies, and current session. By default, the forms that are used in the views accept the GET or POST parameters, files, initial data, and other parameters; however, not the HttpRequest object. In some cases, it is useful to additionally pass HttpRequest to the form, especially when you want to filter out the choices of form fields using the request data or handle saving something such as the current user or IP in the form.  

In this recipe, we will see an example of a form where a person can choose a user and write a message to them. We will pass the HttpRequest object to the form in order to exclude the current user from the recipient choices; we don't want anybody to write a message to themselves.  

### Getting ready

Let's create a new app called email_messages and put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. This app will have no models, just forms and views.  

### How to do it…

To complete this recipe, execute the following steps:  

1. Add a new forms.py file with the message form containing two fields: the recipient selection and message text. Also, this form will have an initialization method, which will accept the request object and then, modify QuerySet for the recipient's selection field:  

```python
# email_messages/forms.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django import forms
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class MessageForm(forms.Form):
    recipient = forms.ModelChoiceField(
        label=_("Recipient"),
        queryset=User.objects.all(),
        required=True,
    )
    message = forms.CharField(
        label=_("Message"),
        widget=forms.Textarea,
        required=True,
    )

    def __init__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MessageForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.request = request
        self.fields["recipient"].queryset = \
            self.fields["recipient"].queryset.\
            exclude(pk=request.user.pk)
```

Then, create views.py with the message_to_user() view in order to handle the form. As you can see, the request object is passed as the first parameter to the form, as follows:  

```python
# email_messages/views.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from .forms import MessageForm

@login_required
def message_to_user(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = MessageForm(request, data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # do something with the form
            return redirect("message_to_user_done")
    else:
        form = MessageForm(request)

    return render(request,
        "email_messages/message_to_user.html",
        {"form": form}
    )
```

### How it works…

In the initialization method, we have the self variable that represents the instance of the form itself, we also have the newly added request variable, and then we have the rest of the positional arguments (*args) and named arguments (**kwargs). We call the super() initialization method passing all the positional and named arguments to it so that the form is properly initiated. We will then assign the request variable to a new request attribute of the form for later access in other methods of the form. Then, we modify the queryset attribute of the recipient's selection field, excluding the current user from the request.  

In the view, we will pass the HttpRequest object as the first argument in both situations: when the form is posted, as well as when it is loaded for the first time.

- The Utilizing the save method of the form recipe

## Utilizing the save method of the form

To make your views clean and simple, it is good practice to move the handling of the form data to the form itself whenever possible and makes sense. The common practice is to have a save() method that will save the data, perform search, or do some other smart actions. We will extend the form that is defined in the previous recipe with the save() method, which will send an e-mail to the selected recipient.  

### Getting ready

We will build upon the example that is defined in the Passing HttpRequest to the form recipe.  

### How to do it…

To complete this recipe, execute the following two steps:  

1. From Django, import the function in order to send an e-mail. Then, add the save() method to MessageForm. It will try to send an e-mail to the selected recipient and will fail silently if any errors occur:  

```python
# email_messages/forms.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django import forms
from django.utils.translation import ugettext,\
    ugettext_lazy as _
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class MessageForm(forms.Form):
    recipient = forms.ModelChoiceField(
        label=_("Recipient"),
        queryset=User.objects.all(),
        required=True,
    )
    message = forms.CharField(
        label=_("Message"),
        widget=forms.Textarea,
        required=True,
    )

    def __init__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MessageForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.request = request
        self.fields["recipient"].queryset = \
            self.fields["recipient"].queryset.\
            exclude(pk=request.user.pk)

    def save(self):
        cleaned_data = self.cleaned_data
        send_mail(
            subject=ugettext("A message from %s") % \
                self.request.user,
            message=cleaned_data["message"],
            from_email=self.request.user.email,
            recipient_list=[
                cleaned_data["recipient"].email
            ],
            fail_silently=True,
        )
```

2. Then, call the save() method from the form in the view if the posted data is valid:  

```python
# email_messages/views.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

from .forms import MessageForm

@login_required
def message_to_user(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = MessageForm(request, data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect("message_to_user_done")
    else:
        form = MessageForm(request)

    return render(request,
        "email_messages/message_to_user.html",
        {"form": form}
    )
```

## How it works…

Let's take a look at the form. The save() method uses the cleaned data from the form to read the recipient's e-mail address and the message. The sender of the e-mail is the current user from the request. If the e-mail cannot be sent due to an incorrect mail server configuration or another reason, it will fail silently; that is, no error will be raised.  

Now, let's look at the view. When the posted form is valid, the save() method of the form will be called and the user will be redirected to the success page.

## Uploading images

In this recipe, we will take a look at the easiest way to handle image uploads. You will see an example of an app, where the visitors can upload images with inspirational quotes.  

### Getting ready

Make sure to have Pillow or PIL installed in your virtual environment or globally.  

Then, let's create a quotes app and put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. Then, we will add an InspirationalQuote model with three fields: the author, quote text, and picture, as follows:  

```python
# quotes/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import os
from django.db import models
from django.utils.timezone import now as timezone_now
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible

def upload_to(instance, filename):
    now = timezone_now()
    filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    return "quotes/%s%s" % (
        now.strftime("%Y/%m/%Y%m%d%H%M%S"),
        filename_ext.lower(),
    )
    
@python_2_unicode_compatible
class InspirationalQuote(models.Model):
    author = models.CharField(_("Author"), max_length=200)
    quote = models.TextField(_("Quote"))
    picture = models.ImageField(_("Picture"),
        upload_to=upload_to,
        blank=True,
        null=True,
    )
    
    class Meta:
        verbose_name = _("Inspirational Quote")
        verbose_name_plural = _("Inspirational Quotes")
        
    def __str__(self):
        return self.quote
```

In addition, we created an upload_to() function, which sets the path of the uploaded picture to be something similar to quotes/2015/04/20150424140000.png. As you can see, we use the date timestamp as the filename to ensure its uniqueness. We pass this function to the picture image field.  

### How to do it…

Execute these steps to complete the recipe:  

1. Create the forms.py file and put a simple model form there:  

```python
# quotes/forms.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django import forms
from .models import InspirationalQuote


class InspirationalQuoteForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = InspirationalQuote
        fields = ["author", "quote", "picture", "language"]
```

2. In the views.py file, put a view that handles the form. Don't forget to pass the FILES dictionary-like object to the form. When the form is valid, trigger the save method as follows:  

```python
# quotes/views.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.shortcuts import redirect
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import InspirationalQuoteForm

def add_quote(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = InspirationalQuoteForm(
            data=request.POST,
            files=request.FILES,
        )
        if form.is_valid():
            quote = form.save()
            return redirect("add_quote_done")
    else:
        form = InspirationalQuoteForm()
    return render(request,
        "quotes/change_quote.html",
        {"form": form}
    )
```

3. Lastly, create a template for the view in templates/quotes/change_quote.html. It is very important to set the enctype attribute to multipart/form-data for the HTML form, otherwise the file upload won't work:  

```html
{# templates/quotes/change_quote.html #}
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load i18n %}

{% block content %}
    <form method="post" action="" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">{% trans "Save" %}</button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

### How it works…

Django model forms are forms that are created from models. They provide all the fields from the model so you don't need to define them again. In the preceding example, we created a model form for the InspirationalQuote model. When we save the form, the form knows how to save each field in the database, as well as to upload the files and save them in the media directory.  

### There's more

As a bonus, we will see an example of how to generate a thumbnail out of the uploaded image. Using this technique, you could also generate several other specific versions of the image, such as the list version, mobile version, and desktop computer version.  

We will add three methods to the InspirationalQuote model (quotes/models.py). They are save(), create_thumbnail(), and get_thumbnail_picture_url(). When the model is being saved, we will trigger the creation of the thumbnail. When we need to show the thumbnail in a template, we can get its URL using {{ quote.get_thumbnail_picture_url }}. The method definitions are as follows:  

```python
# quotes/models.py
# …
from PIL import Image
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.files.storage import default_storage as storage
THUMBNAIL_SIZE = getattr(
    settings,
    "QUOTES_THUMBNAIL_SIZE",
    (50, 50)
)

class InspirationalQuote(models.Model):
    # …
    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(InspirationalQuote, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
        # generate thumbnail picture version
        self.create_thumbnail()

    def create_thumbnail(self):
        if not self.picture:
            return ""
        file_path = self.picture.name
        filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        thumbnail_file_path = "%s_thumbnail.jpg" % filename_base
        if storage.exists(thumbnail_file_path):
            # if thumbnail version exists, return its url path
            return "exists"
        try:
            # resize the original image and
            # return URL path of the thumbnail version
            f = storage.open(file_path, 'r')
            image = Image.open(f)
            width, height = image.size

            if width > height:
                delta = width - height
                left = int(delta/2)
                upper = 0
                right = height + left
                lower = height
            else:
                delta = height - width
                left = 0
                upper = int(delta/2)
                right = width
                lower = width + upper

            image = image.crop((left, upper, right, lower))
            image = image.resize(THUMBNAIL_SIZE, Image.ANTIALIAS)

            f_mob = storage.open(thumbnail_file_path, "w")
            image.save(f_mob, "JPEG")
            f_mob.close()
            return "success"
        except:
            return "error"

    def get_thumbnail_picture_url(self):
        if not self.picture:
            return ""
        file_path = self.picture.name
        filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        thumbnail_file_path = "%s_thumbnail.jpg" % filename_base
        if storage.exists(thumbnail_file_path):
            # if thumbnail version exists, return its URL path
            return storage.url(thumbnail_file_path)
        # return original as a fallback
        return self.picture.url
```

In the preceding methods, we are using the file storage API instead of directly juggling the filesystem, as we could then exchange the default storage with Amazon S3 buckets or other storage services and the methods will still work.  

How does the creating the thumbnail work? If we had the original file saved as quotes/2014/04/20140424140000.png, we are checking whether the quotes/2014/04/20140424140000_thumbnail.jpg file doesn't exist and, in that case, we are opening the original image, cropping it from the center, resizing it to 50 x 50 pixels, and saving it to the storage.  

The get_thumbnail_picture_url() method checks whether the thumbnail version exists in the storage and returns its URL. If the thumbnail version does not exist, the URL of the original image is returned as a fallback.

## Creating a form layout with django-crispy-forms

The django-crispy-forms Django app allows you to build, customize, and reuse forms using one of the following CSS frameworks: Uni-Form, Bootstrap, or Foundation. The usage of django-crispy-forms is analogous to fieldsets in the Django contributed administration; however, it is more advanced and customizable. You define form layout in the Python code and you don't need to worry about how each field is presented in HTML. However, if you need to add specific HTML attributes or wrapping, you can easily do that too. Moreover, all the markup used by django-crispy-forms is located in the templates that can be overwritten for specific needs.  

In this recipe, we will see an example of how to use django-crispy-forms with Bootstrap 3, which is the most popular frontend framework to develop responsive, mobile-first web projects.  

### Getting ready

To start with, execute the following tasks one by one:  

Download the Bootstrap frontend framework from http://getbootstrap.com/ and integrate CSS and JavaScript in the templates. Learn more about this in the Arranging the base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.  

Install django-crispy-forms in your virtual environment using the following command:  

```shell
(myproject_env)$ pip install django-crispy-forms
```

Make sure that crispy_forms is added to INSTALLED_APPS and then set bootstrap3 as the template pack to be used in this project:  

```python
# conf/base.py or settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # …
    "crispy_forms",
)
# …
CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap3"
```

Let's create a bulletin_board app to illustrate the usage of django-crispy-forms and put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. We will have a Bulletin model there with these fields: bulletin_type, title, description, contact_person, phone, email, and image as follows:  

```python
# bulletin_board/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible

TYPE_CHOICES = (
    ('searching', _("Searching")),
    ('offering', _("Offering")),
)

@python_2_unicode_compatible
class Bulletin(models.Model):
    bulletin_type = models.CharField(_("Type"), max_length=20, choices=TYPE_CHOICES)
    
    title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(_("Description"),
        max_length=300)
    
    contact_person = models.CharField(_("Contact person"),
        max_length=255)
    phone = models.CharField(_("Phone"), max_length=200,
blank=True)
    email = models.EmailField(_("Email"), blank=True)
    
    image = models.ImageField(_("Image"), max_length=255,
        upload_to="bulletin_board/", blank=True)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = _("Bulletin")
        verbose_name_plural = _("Bulletins")
        ordering = ("title",)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### How to do it…

Follow these steps:  

1. Let's add a model form for the bulletin in the newly created app. We will attach a form helper to the form in the initialization method itself. The form helper will have the layout property that will define the layout for the form, as follows:  

```python
# bulletin_board/forms.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from django import forms
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _,\
    ugettext
from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
from crispy_forms import layout, bootstrap
from .models import Bulletin

class BulletinForm(forms.ModelForm):
  class Meta:
    model = Bulletin
    fields = ["bulletin_type", "title", "description", 
    "contact_person", "phone", "email", "image"]

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
      super(BulletinForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

      self.helper = FormHelper()
      self.helper.form_action = ""
      self.helper.form_method = "POST"

      self.fields["bulletin_type"].widget = \
        forms.RadioSelect()
      # delete empty choice for the type
      del self.fields["bulletin_type"].choices[0]

      self.helper.layout = layout.Layout(
        layout.Fieldset(
          _("Main data"),
          layout.Field("bulletin_type"),
          layout.Field("title", 
            css_class="input-block-level"),
            layout.Field("description", 
            css_class="input-blocklevel",
            rows="3"),
          ),
          layout.Fieldset(
            _("Image"),
            layout.Field("image", 
              css_class="input-block-level"),
            layout.HTML(u"""{% load i18n %}
              <p class="help-block">{% trans "Available formats are JPG, GIF, and PNG. Minimal size is 800 × 800 px." %}</p>
            """),
            title=_("Image upload"),
            css_id="image_fieldset",
          ),
          layout.Fieldset(
            _("Contact"),
            layout.Field("contact_person",
              css_class="input-blocklevel"),
            layout.Div(
              bootstrap.PrependedText("phone",
              """<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-earphone">
              </span>""", 
                css_class="inputblock-level"),
              bootstrap.PrependedText("email", "@",
                css_class="input-block-level",
                placeholder="contact@example.com"),
              css_id="contact_info",
            ),
          ),
          bootstrap.FormActions(
            layout.Submit("submit", _("Save")),
          )
        )
```

1. To render the form in the template, we just need to load the crispy_forms_tags template tag library and use the {% crispy %} template tag as shown in the following:  

```html
{# templates/bulletin_board/change_form.html #}
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}

{% block content %}
    {% crispy form %}
{% endblock %}
```

2. Create the base.html template. You can do this according to the example in the Arranging the base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.  

### How it works…

The page with the bulletin form will look similar to the following:  

![img](images/)
