## Introduction

When you start a new app, the first thing to do is create the models that represent your database structure. We are assuming that you have previously created Django apps or at least, you have read and understood the official Django tutorial. In this chapter, we will see a few interesting techniques that make your database structure consistent throughout different apps in your project. Then, we will see how to create custom model fields in order to handle internationalization of your data in the database. At the end of the chapter, we will see how to use migrations to change your database structure in the process of development.  

## Using model mixins 使用模型Mixin

In object-oriented languages, such as Python, a mixin class can be viewed as an interface with implemented features. When a model extends a mixin, it implements the interface and includes all its fields, properties, and methods. Mixins in Django models can be used when you want to reuse the generic functionalities in different models multiple times.  

在像Python面向对象语言中，minxin类可以看作是一个拥有已实现功能的接口。当模型扩展为mixin，它可以实现接口以及所有自身所有的字段、特性、和方法。Django模型的Mixin可以多次地在不同的模型中重复使用通用功能。  

### Getting ready

First, you will need to create reusable mixins. Some typical examples of mixins are given later in this chapter. A good place to keep your model mixins is in the `utils` module.  

>### Tip
>If you create a reusable app that you will share with others, keep the model mixins in the reusable app, for example, in the base.py file.  

### How to do it…

Open the models.py file of any Django app, where you want to use the mixins and type the following code:  

```python
# demo_app/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible
from utils.models import UrlMixin
from utils.models import CreationModificationMixin
from utils.models import MetaTagsMixin


@python_2_unicode_compatible
class Idea(UrlMixin, CreationModificationMixin, MetaTagsMixin):
  title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=200)
  content = models.TextField(_("Content"))

  class Meta:
    verbose_name = _("Idea")
    verbose_name_plural = _("Ideas")

  def __str__(self):
    return self.title
```

### How it works…

Django model inheritance supports three types of inheritance: abstract base classes, multi-table inheritance, and proxy models. Model mixins are abstract model classes with specified fields, properties, and methods. When you create a model such as Idea, as shown in the preceding example, it inherits all the features from UrlMixin, CreationModificationMixin, and MetaTagsMixin. All the fields of the abstract classes are saved in the same database table as the fields of the extending model. In the following recipes, you will learn how to define your model mixins.  

Django模型即成支持三种类型的继承：抽象基类，多表继承，以及代理模型。模型Mixin是指定了字段、特性和方法的抽象基类。当你依照这个观念来创建模型，就像在之前例子中那样，它降从UrlMixin、CreationModificationMixin, 和 MetaTagsMixin继承所有的功能。抽象基类的所有字段都保存在相同数据库表中，并作为扩展模型的字段。在下面的做法中，你会学习到如何定义自己的模型mixin。  

Note that we are using the @python_2_unicode_compatible decorator for our Idea model. As you might remember from the Making your code compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3 recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Django 1.8, it's purpose is to make the __str__() method compatible with Unicode for both the following Python versions: 2.7 and 3.  

### There's more…

To learn more about the different types of model inheritance, refer to the official Django documentation available at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/models/#model-inheritance.

## Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods

For every model that has its own page, it is good practice to define the get_absolute_url() method. This method can be used in templates and also in the Django admin site to preview the saved object. However, get_absolute_url() is ambiguous as it returns the URL path instead of the full URL. In this recipe, we will see how to create a model mixin that allows you to define either the URL path or the full URL by default, generate the other out of the box, and take care of the `get_absolute_url()` method that is being set.  

### Getting ready

If you haven't done it yet, create the utils package to save your mixins. Then, create the models.py file in the utils package (alternatively, if you create a reusable app, put the mixins in the base.py file in your app).  

### How to do it…

Execute the following steps one by one:  

1. Add the following content to the models.py file of your utils package:  

```python
# utils/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import urlparse
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
from django.conf import settings

class UrlMixin(models.Model):
    """
    A replacement for get_absolute_url Models extending this mixin should have 
    either get_url or get_url_path implemented.
    """
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

    def get_url(self):
        if hasattr(self.get_url_path, "dont_recurse"):
            raise NotImplementedError
        try:
            path = self.get_url_path()
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise
        website_url = getattr(
            settings, "DEFAULT_WEBSITE_URL", "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
        )
        return website_url + path

    get_url.dont_recurse = True

    def get_url_path(self):
        if hasattr(self.get_url, "dont_recurse"):
            raise NotImplementedError
        try:
            url = self.get_url()
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise
        bits = urlparse.urlparse(url)
        return urlparse.urlunparse(("", "") + bits[2:])

    get_url_path.dont_recurse = True

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return self.get_url_path()
```

2. To use the mixin in your app, import it from the utils package, inherit the mixin in your model class, and define the get_url_path() method as follows:  

```python
# demo_app/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
from django.utils.encoding import \
    python_2_unicode_compatible

from utils.models import UrlMixin


@python_2_unicode_compatible
class Idea(UrlMixin):
    title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=200)
    # ...
    get_url_path(self):
        return reverse("idea_details", kwargs={
            "idea_id": str(self.pk),
        })
```

3. If you check this code in the staging or production environment or run a local server with a different IP or port than the defaults, set DEFAULT_WEBSITE_URL in your local settings (without the trailing slash), as follows:  

```python
# settings.py
# …
DEFAULT_WEBSITE_URL = "http://www.example.com"
```
