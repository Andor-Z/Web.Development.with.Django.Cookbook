## Introduction 引言

When you start a new app, the first thing to do is create the models that represent your database structure. We are assuming that you have previously created Django apps or at least, you have read and understood the official Django tutorial. In this chapter, we will see a few interesting techniques that make your database structure consistent throughout different apps in your project. Then, we will see how to create custom model fields in order to handle internationalization of your data in the database. At the end of the chapter, we will see how to use migrations to change your database structure in the process of development.  

当你开始编写一个新应用时，要做的第一件事就是创建代表数据库结构的模型。我们假设你在之前你已经创建了Django应用，至少你阅读过并理解了Django官方教程。本章，我们可以看到一些有趣的能让你项目中的不同应用保持数据库结构一致性的技术。然后我们可以看到如何创建自定义模型字段以便处理数据库中的国际化数据。在章节的最后，我们可以看到如何使用迁移在开发阶段改变数据库结构。  

## Using model mixins 使用模型mixin

In object-oriented languages, such as Python, a mixin class can be viewed as an interface with implemented features. When a model extends a mixin, it implements the interface and includes all its fields, properties, and methods. Mixins in Django models can be used when you want to reuse the generic functionalities in different models multiple times.  

在面相对象语言中，比如Python，mixin类可以看作是一个实现功能的借口。当模型扩展了一个mixin，它便实现了接口，包括所有mixin的全部字段，属性，和方法。Django模型的Mixin可以用在当你想要在不同的模型中多次重复使用通用功能时。  

### Getting ready

First, you will need to create reusable mixins. Some typical examples of mixins are given later in this chapter. A good place to keep your model mixins is in the `utils` module.  

首先，你需要创建可重复使用的mixin。一些mixin的典型例子会在本章稍后给出。一个存放模型mixin的好地方就是`utils`模块。  

>### Tip
>If you create a reusable app that you will share with others, keep the model mixins in the reusable app, for example, in the base.py file.  

>### 提示
>如果你要创建一个和其他人分享的可重复使用的应用，请将模型mixin放到可重复使用的应用中，例如，base.py

### How to do it…
Open the models.py file of any Django app, where you want to use the mixins and type the following code:  

打开任意一个Django应用中的models.py文件，在这个文件中你需要使用mixin，并输入以下代码：  

```python
# demo_app/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible
from utils.models import UrlMixin
from utils.models import CreationModificationMixin
from utils.models import MetaTagsMixin


@python_2_unicode_compatible
class Idea(UrlMixin, CreationModificationMixin, MetaTagsMixin):
  title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=200)
  content = models.TextField(_("Content"))

  class Meta:
    verbose_name = _("Idea")
    verbose_name_plural = _("Ideas")

  def __str__(self):
    return self.title
```

### How it works…

Django model inheritance supports three types of inheritance: abstract base classes, multi-table inheritance, and proxy models. Model mixins are abstract model classes with specified fields, properties, and methods. When you create a model such as Idea, as shown in the preceding example, it inherits all the features from UrlMixin, CreationModificationMixin, and MetaTagsMixin. All the fields of the abstract classes are saved in the same database table as the fields of the extending model. In the following recipes, you will learn how to define your model mixins.  

Django的模型支持三种类型的继承：抽象基类，多表继承，以及代理模型。模型mixin是拥有特定字段、属性和方法的抽象模型类。

Note that we are using the @python_2_unicode_compatible decorator for our Idea model. As you might remember from the Making your code compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3 recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Django 1.8, it's purpose is to make the __str__() method compatible with Unicode for both the following Python versions: 2.7 and 3.  

### There's more…

To learn more about the different types of model inheritance, refer to the official Django documentation available at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/models/#model-inheritance.

## Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods

For every model that has its own page, it is good practice to define the get_absolute_url() method. This method can be used in templates and also in the Django admin site to preview the saved object. However, get_absolute_url() is ambiguous as it returns the URL path instead of the full URL. In this recipe, we will see how to create a model mixin that allows you to define either the URL path or the full URL by default, generate the other out of the box, and take care of the `get_absolute_url()` method that is being set.  

### Getting ready

If you haven't done it yet, create the utils package to save your mixins. Then, create the models.py file in the utils package (alternatively, if you create a reusable app, put the mixins in the base.py file in your app).  

### How to do it…

Execute the following steps one by one:  

1. Add the following content to the models.py file of your utils package:  

```python
# utils/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import urlparse
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
from django.conf import settings

class UrlMixin(models.Model):
    """
    A replacement for get_absolute_url Models extending this mixin should have 
    either get_url or get_url_path implemented.
    """
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

    def get_url(self):
        if hasattr(self.get_url_path, "dont_recurse"):
            raise NotImplementedError
        try:
            path = self.get_url_path()
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise
        website_url = getattr(
            settings, "DEFAULT_WEBSITE_URL", "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
        )
        return website_url + path

    get_url.dont_recurse = True

    def get_url_path(self):
        if hasattr(self.get_url, "dont_recurse"):
            raise NotImplementedError
        try:
            url = self.get_url()
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise
        bits = urlparse.urlparse(url)
        return urlparse.urlunparse(("", "") + bits[2:])

    get_url_path.dont_recurse = True

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return self.get_url_path()
```

2. To use the mixin in your app, import it from the utils package, inherit the mixin in your model class, and define the get_url_path() method as follows:  

```python
# demo_app/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
from django.utils.encoding import \
    python_2_unicode_compatible

from utils.models import UrlMixin


@python_2_unicode_compatible
class Idea(UrlMixin):
    title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=200)
    # ...
    get_url_path(self):
        return reverse("idea_details", kwargs={
            "idea_id": str(self.pk),
        })
```

3. If you check this code in the staging or production environment or run a local server with a different IP or port than the defaults, set DEFAULT_WEBSITE_URL in your local settings (without the trailing slash), as follows:  

```python
# settings.py
# …
DEFAULT_WEBSITE_URL = "http://www.example.com"
```
