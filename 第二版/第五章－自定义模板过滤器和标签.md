## Introduction

As you know, Django has an extensive template system with features such as template inheritance, filters to change the representation of values, and tags for presentational logic. Moreover, Django allows you to add your own template filters and tags to your apps. Custom filters or tags should be located in a template-tag library file under the templatetags Python package in your app. Then, your template-tag library can be loaded in any template with a {% load %} template tag. In this chapter, we will create several useful filters and tags that will give more control to template editors.  
 
To see the template tags of this chapter in action, create a virtual environment, extract the code provided for this chapter there, run the development server, and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/en/ in a browser.  

## Following conventions for your own template filters and tags

Custom template filters and tags can become a total mess if you don't have persistent guidelines to follow. Template filters and tags should serve template editors as much as possible. They should be both handy and flexible. In this recipe, we will take a look at some conventions that should be used when enhancing the functionality of the Django template system.  

### How to do it...

Follow these conventions when extending the Django template system:  

1. Don't create or use custom template filters or tags when the logic for the page fits better in the view, context processors, or model methods. When your content is context-specific, such as a list of objects or object-detail view, load the object in the view. If you need to show some content on every page, create a context processor. Use custom methods of the model instead of template filters when you need to get some properties of an object that are not related to the context of the template.
2. Name the template-tag library with the _tags suffix. When your app is named differently than your template-tag library, you can avoid ambiguous package importing problems.

3. In the newly created library, separate the filters from tags, for example, using comments as shown the following code:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django import template
register = template.Library()

### FILTERS ###
# .. your filters go here..

### TAGS ###
# .. your tags go here..
```

4. When creating advanced custom template tags, make sure that their syntax is easy to remember by including the following constructs:  

- for [app_name.model_name]: Include this construct in order to use a specific model
- using [template_name]: Include this construct in order to use a template for the output of the template tag
- limit [count]: Include this construct in order to limit the results to a specific amount
- as [context_variable]: Include this construct in order to save the results to a context variable that can be reused multiple times

5. Try to avoid multiple values that are defined positionally in the template tags, unless they are self-explanatory. Otherwise, this will likely confuse the template developers.
6. Make as many resolvable arguments as possible. Strings without quotes should be treated as context variables that need to be resolved or short words that remind you of the structure of the template tag components.

## Creating a template filter to show how many days have passed since a post was published

Not all people keep track of the date and when talking about creation or modification dates of cutting-edge information; for many of us, it is convenient to read the time difference. For example, the blog entry was posted three days ago, the news article was published today, and the user last logged in yesterday. In this recipe, we will create a template filter named days_since, which converts dates to humanized time differences.  

### Getting ready

Create the utils app and put it under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings, if you haven't done that yet. Then, create a templatetags Python package in this app (Python packages are directories with an empty `__init__.py` file).  

### How to do it...

Create a utility_tags.py file with the following content:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from datetime import datetime
from django import template
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.utils.timezone import now as tz_now
register = template.Library()

### FILTERS ###

@register.filter
def days_since(value):
    """ Returns number of days between today and value."""

    today = tz_now().date()
    if isinstance(value, datetime.datetime):
        value = value.date()
    diff = today - value
    if diff.days > 1:
        return _("%s days ago") % diff.days
    elif diff.days == 1:
        return _("yesterday")
    elif diff.days == 0:
        return _("today")
    else:
        # Date is in the future; return formatted date.
        return value.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
```

### How it works...

If you use this filter in a template as shown in the following code, it will render something similar to yesterday or 5 days ago:  

```python
{% load utility_tags %}
{{ object.published|days_since }}
```

You can apply this filter to values of the date and datetime types.  

Each template-tag library has a register, where filters and tags are collected. Django filters are functions registered by the @register.filter decorator. By default, the filter in the template system will be named same as the function or other callable object. If you want, you can set a different name for the filter by passing the name to the decorator, as follows:  

```python
@register.filter(name="humanized_days_since")
def days_since(value):
    ...
```

The filter itself is quite self-explanatory. At first, the current date is read. If the given value of the filter is of the datetime type, date is extracted. Then, the difference between today and the extracted value is calculated. Depending on the number of days, different string results are returned.  

### There's more...

This filter is also easy to extend in order to show the difference in time, such as just now, 7 minutes ago, and 3 hours ago. Just operate on the datetime values instead of the date values.

## Creating a template filter to extract the first media object

Imagine that you are developing a blog overview page, and for each post, you want to show images, music, or videos in that page taken from the content. In such a case, you need to extract the <figure>, <img>, <object>, <embed>, <video>, <audio>, and <iframe> tags from the HTML content of the post. In this recipe, we will see how to perform this using regular expressions in the first_media filter.  

### Getting ready

We will start with the utils app that should be set in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings and the templatetags package in this app.  

### How to do it...

In the utility_tags.py file, add the following content:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import re
from django import template
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
register = template.Library()

### FILTERS ###


media_tags_regex = re.compile(
    r"<figure[\S\s]+?</figure>|"
    r"<object[\S\s]+?</object>|"
    r"<video[\S\s]+?</video>|"
    r"<audio[\S\s]+?</audio>|"
    r"<iframe[\S\s]+?</iframe>|"
    r"<(img|embed)[^>]+>",
    re.MULTILINE
)

@register.filter
def first_media(content):
    """ Returns the first image or flash file from the html
 content """
    m = media_tags_regex.search(content)
    media_tag = ""
    if m:
        media_tag = m.group()
    return mark_safe(media_tag)
```

### How it works...

If the HTML content in the database is valid, when you put the following code in the template, it will retrieve the media tags from the content field of the object; otherwise, an empty string will be returned if no media is found:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{{ object.content|first_media }}
```

Regular expressions are powerful feature to search/replace patterns of text. At first, we will define the compiled regular expression as media_file_regex. In our case, we will search for all the possible media tags that can also occur in multiple lines.  

>#### Tip
>Python strings can be concatenated without a plus (+) symbol.

>#### 提示
>Python字符串可以不适用加好进行连接。   

Let's see how this regular expression works, as follows:  

如下， 让我们来看看这个正则表达式是如何工作的：  

- Alternating patterns are separated by the pipe (|) symbol.
- For possibly multiline tags, we will use the [\S\s]+? pattern that matches any symbol at least once; however, as little times as possible, until we find the the string that goes after it. Therefore, <figure[\S\s]+?</figure> searches for a <figure> tag and everything after it, until it finds the closing </figure> tag.
- Similarly, with the [^>]+ pattern, we search for any symbol except the greater than (>) symbol at least once and as many times as possible.

- 

The re.MULTILINE flag ensures that the search will happen in multiple lines. Then, in the filter, we will perform a search for this regular expression pattern. By default, the result of the filter will show the <, >, and & symbols escaped as the &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; entities. However, we use the mark_safe() function that marks the result as safe and HTML-ready in order to be shown in the template without escaping.

If you are interested in regular expressions, you can learn more about them in the official Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html.

- The Creating a template filter to humanize URLs recipe

## Creating a template filter to humanize URLs

Usually, common web users enter URLs in address fields without protocol and trailing slashes. In this recipe, we will create a humanize_url filter that is used to present URLs to the user in a shorter format, truncating very long addresses, similar to what Twitter does with the links in the tweets.  

### Getting ready

Similar to the previous recipes, we will start with the utils app that should be set in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings and contain the templatetags package.  

### How to do it...

In the FILTERS section of the utility_tags.py template library in the utils app, let's add a humanize_url filter and register it, as shown in the following code:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import re
from django import template
register = template.Library()

### FILTERS ###

@register.filter
def humanize_url(url, letter_count):
    """ Returns a shortened human-readable URL """
    letter_count = int(letter_count)
    re_start = re.compile(r"^https?://")
    re_end = re.compile(r"/$")
    url = re_end.sub("", re_start.sub("", url))
    if len(url) > letter_count:
        url = "%s…" % url[:letter_count - 1]
    return url
```

#### How it works...

We can use the humanize_url filter in any template, as follows:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
<a href="{{ object.website }}" target="_blank">
    {{ object.website|humanize_url:30 }}
</a>
```

The filter uses regular expressions to remove the leading protocol and trailing slash, shorten the URL to the given amount of letters, and add an ellipsis to the end if the URL doesn't fit in the specified letter count.

## Creating a template tag to include a template if it exists

Django has the {% include %} template tag that renders and includes another template. However, there is a problem in some situations, where an error is raised if the template does not exist. In this recipe, we will see how to create a {% try_to_include %} template tag that includes another template and fails silently if there is no such template.  

### Getting ready

We will start again with the utils app that is installed and ready for custom template tags.  

### How to do it...

Advanced custom template tags consist of two things: the function that is parsing the arguments of the template tag and the Node class that is responsible for the logic of the template tag as well as the output. Perform the following steps to create the {% try_to_include %} template tag:  

1. First, let's create the function parsing the template-tag arguments, as follows:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django import template
from django.template.loader import get_template
register = template.Library()

### TAGS ###

@register.tag
def try_to_include(parser, token):
  """Usage: {% try_to_include "sometemplate.html" %}
  This will fail silently if the template doesn't exist.
  If it does exist, it will be rendered with the current
  context."""
  try:
    tag_name, template_name = token.split_contents()
  except ValueError:
    raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \
      "%r tag requires a single argument" % \
      token.contents.split()[0]
  return IncludeNode(template_name)
```

2. Then, we need the Node class in the same file, as follows:  

```python
class IncludeNode(template.Node):
  def __init__(self, template_name):
    self.template_name = template_name

  def render(self, context):
    try:
      # Loading the template and rendering it
      template_name = template.resolve_variable(
        self. template_name, context)
      included_template = get_template(
        template_name
      ).render(context)
    except template.TemplateDoesNotExist:
      included_template = ""
    return included_template
```

### How it works...

The {% try_to_include %} template tag expects one argument, that is, template_name. Therefore, in the try_to_include() function, we try to assign the split contents of the token only to the tag_name variable (which is try_to_include) and the template_name variable. If this doesn't work, the template syntax error is raised. The function returns the IncludeNode object, which gets the template_name field for later use.  

In the render() method of IncludeNode, we resolve the template_name variable. If a context variable was passed to the template tag, its value will be used here for template_name. If a quoted string was passed to the template tag, then the content in the quotes will be used for template_name.  

Lastly, we will try to load the template and render it with the current template context. If that doesn't work, an empty string is returned.  

There are at least two situations where we could use this template tag:  

It is used when including a template whose path is defined in a model, as follows:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{% try_to_include object.template_path %}
```

It is used when including a template whose path is defined with the {% with %} template tag somewhere high in the template context variable's scope. This is especially useful when you need to create custom layouts for plugins in the placeholder of a template in Django CMS:  

```html
{# templates/cms/start_page.html #}
{% with editorial_content_template_path="cms/plugins/editorial_content/start_page.html" %}
    {% placeholder "main_content" %}
{% endwith %}

{# templates/cms/plugins/editorial_content.html #}
{% load utility_tags %}

{% if editorial_content_template_path %}
    {% try_to_include editorial_content_template_path %}
{% else %}
    <div>
        <!-- Some default presentation of
             editorial content plugin -->
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

### There's more...

You can use the {% try_to_include %} tag as well as the default {% include %} tag to include the templates that extend other templates. This is beneficial for large-scale portals, where you have different kinds of lists in which complex items share the same structure as widgets but have a different source of data.  

For example, in the artist list template, you can include the artist item template, as follows:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{% for object in object_list %}
    {% try_to_include "artists/includes/artist_item.html" %}
{% endfor %}
```

This template will extend from the item base, as follows:  

```html
{# templates/artists/includes/artist_item.html #}
{% extends "utils/includes/item_base.html" %}

{% block item_title %}
    {{ object.first_name }} {{ object.last_name }}
{% endblock %}
```

The item base defines the markup for any item and also includes a Like widget, as follows:  

```html
{# templates/utils/includes/item_base.html #}
{% load likes_tags %}

<h3>{% block item_title %}{% endblock %}</h3>
{% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
    {% like_widget for object %}
{% endif %}
```

## Creating a template tag to load a QuerySet in a template

Most often, the content that should be shown on a webpage will have to be defined in the view. If this is the content to be shown on every page, it is logical to create a context processor. Another situation is where you need to show additional content such as the latest news or a random quote on some pages; for example, the starting page or the details page of an object. In this case, you can load the necessary content with the {% get_objects %} template tag, which we will implement in this recipe.  

### Getting ready

Once again, we will start with the utils app that should be installed and ready for custom template tags.  

### How to do it...

An advanced custom template tag consists of a function that parses arguments that are passed to the tag and a Node class that renders the output of the tag or modifies the template context. Perform the following steps to create the {% get_objects %} template tag:  

1. First, let's create the function parsing the template-tag arguments, as follows:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.db import models
from django import template
register = template.Library()

### TAGS ###

@register.tag
def get_objects(parser, token):
    """
    Gets a queryset of objects of the model specified
    by app and model names
    Usage:
        {% get_objects [<manager>.]<method> from
<app_name>.<model_name> [limit <amount>] as
        <var_name> %}
    Example:
        {% get_objects latest_published from people.Person
limit 3 as people %}
        {% get_objects site_objects.all from news.Article
        limit 3 as articles %}
        {% get_objects site_objects.all from news.Article
         as articles %}
    """
    amount = None
    try:
        tag_name, manager_method, str_from, appmodel, \
        str_limit, amount, str_as, var_name = \
            token.split_contents()
    except ValueError:
        try:
            tag_name, manager_method, str_from, appmodel, \
            str_as, var_name = token.split_contents()
        except ValueError:
            raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \
                "get_objects tag requires a following "\
                "syntax: "\
                "{% get_objects [<manager>.]<method> "\
                "from <app_ name>.<model_name> "\
                "[limit <amount>] as <var_name> %}"
    try:
        app_name, model_name = appmodel.split(".")
    except ValueError:
        raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \
            "get_objects tag requires application name "\
            "and model name separated by a dot"
    model = models.get_model(app_name, model_name)
    return ObjectsNode(
        model, manager_method, amount, var_name
    )
```

2. Then, we will create the Node class in the same file, as shown in the following code:  

```python
class ObjectsNode(template.Node):
    def __init__(
        self, model, manager_method, amount, var_name
    ):
        self.model = model
        self.manager_method = manager_method
        self.amount = amount
        self.var_name = var_name

    def render(self, context):
        if "." in self.manager_method:
            manager, method = \
                self.manager_method.split(".")
        else:
            manager = "_default_manager"
            method = self.manager_method

        qs = getattr(
            getattr(self.model, manager),
            method,
            self.model._default_manager.none,
        )()
        if self.amount:
            amount = template.resolve_variable(
                self.amount, context
            )
            context[self.var_name] = qs[:amount]
        else:
            context[self.var_name] = qs
        return ""
```

### How it works...

The {% get_objects %} template tag loads QuerySet defined by the method of the manager from a specified app and model, limits the result to the specified amount, and saves the result to a context variable.  

The following code is the simplest example of how to use the template tag that we have just created. It will load all news articles in any template using the following snippet:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{% get_objects all from news.Article as all_articles %}
{% for article in all_articles %}
    <a href="{{ article.get_url_path }}">{{ article.title }}</a>
{% endfor %}
```

This is using the all() method of the default objects manager of the Article model and it will sort the articles by the ordering attribute defined in the Meta class of the model.  

A more advanced example would be required to create a custom manager with a custom method to query the objects from the database. A manager is an interface that provides the database query operations to models. Each model has at least one manager called objects by default. As an example, let's create an Artist model that has a draft or published status and a new custom_manager that allows you to select random published artists:  

```
# artists/models.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

STATUS_CHOICES = (
    ("draft", _("Draft"),
    ("published", _("Published"),
)
class ArtistManager(models.Manager):
    def random_published(self):
        return self.filter(status="published").order_by("?")

class Artist(models.Model):
    # ...
    status = models.CharField(_("Status"), max_length=20, 
        choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
    custom_manager =  ArtistManager()
```

To load a random published artist, you add the following snippet to any template:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{% get_objects custom_manager.random_published from artists.Artist limit 1 as random_artists %}
{% for artist in random_artists %}
    {{ artist.first_name }} {{ artist.last_name }}
{% endfor %}
```

Let us look at the code of the {% get_objects %} template tag. In the parsing function, there is one of the two formats expected; with the limit and without it. The string is parsed, the model is recognized, and then the components of the template tag are passed to the ObjectNode class.  

In the render() method of the Node class, we will check the manager's name and its method's name. If this is not defined, _default_manager will be used, which is an automatic property of any model injected by Django and points to the first available models.Manager() instance. In most cases, _default_manager will be same as objects. After that, we will call the method of the manager and fall back to empty QuerySet if the method doesn't exist. If a limit is defined, we will resolve the value of it and limit QuerySet. Lastly, we will save the QuerySet to the context variable.

## Creating a template tag to parse content as a template

In this recipe, we will create a {% parse %} template tag, which will allow you to put template snippets in the database. This is valuable when you want to provide different content for authenticated and unauthenticated users, when you want to include a personalized salutation or you don't want to hardcode the media paths in the database.  

### Getting ready

As usual, we will start with the utils app that should be installed and ready for custom template tags.  
  
### How to do it...

An advanced custom template tag consists of a function that parses the arguments that are passed to the tag and a Node class that renders the output of the tag or modifies the template context. Perform the following steps to create them:

    bits = token.split_contents()
    tag_name = bits.pop(0)
    try:

        var_name = None
        if len(bits) == 2:
            bits.pop(0)  # remove the word "as"
            var_name = bits.pop(0)
    except ValueError:
        raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \

                context_vars[var] = val
        result = t.render(template.RequestContext(
            context["request"], context_vars))
        if self.var_name:
            context[self.var_name] = result
            return ""
        return result
```

### How it works...

The {% parse %} template tag allows you to parse a value as a template and render it immediately or save it as a context variable.  

If we have an object with a description field, which can contain template variables or logic, we can parse and render it using the following code:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{% parse object.description %}
```

It is also possible to define a value in order to parse using a quoted string as shown in the following code:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
{% parse "{{ STATIC_URL }}site/img/" as img_path %}
<img src="{{ img_path }}someimage.png" alt="" />
```

Let's take a look at the code of the {% parse %} template tag. The parsing function checks the arguments of the template tag bit by bit. At first, we expect the parse name, then the template value, and at last we expect the optional as word followed by the context variable name. The template value and variable name are passed to the ParseNode class. The render() method of that class, at first, resolves the value of the template variable and creates a template object out of it. Then, it renders the template with all the context variables. If the variable name is defined, the result is saved to it; otherwise, the result is shown immediately.

## Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters

Django has a convenient and flexible system to create canonical and clean URLs just by adding regular expression rules to the URL configuration files. However, there is a lack of built-in mechanisms in order to manage query parameters. Views such as search or filterable object lists need to accept query parameters to drill down through the filtered results using another parameter or to go to another page. In this recipe, we will create the {% modify_query %}, {% add_to_query %}, and {% remove_from_query %} template tags, which let you add, change, or remove the parameters of the current query.  

### Getting ready

Once again, we start with the utils app that should be set in INSTALLED_APPS and contain the templatetags package.  

Also, make sure that you have the request context processor set for the TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting, as follows:  

```python
# conf/base.py or settings.py
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    "django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",
    "django.core.context_processors.debug",
    "django.core.context_processors.i18n",
    "django.core.context_processors.media",
    "django.core.context_processors.static",
    "django.core.context_processors.tz",
    "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages",
    "django.core.context_processors.request",
)
```

### How to do it...

For these template tags, we will be using the simple_tag decorator that parses the components and requires you to just define the rendering function, as follows:  

1. At first, we will create the {% modify_query %} template tag:  

```python
# utils/templatetags/utility_tags.py
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import urllib
from django import template
from django.utils.encoding import force_str
register = template.Library()

### TAGS ###

@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def modify_query(
    context, *params_to_remove, **params_to_change
):
    """ Renders a link with modified current query
    parameters """
    query_params = []
    for key, value_list in \
        context["request"].GET._iterlists():
        if not key in params_to_remove:
            # don't add key-value pairs for
            # params_to_change
            if key in params_to_change:
                query_params.append(
                    (key, params_to_change[key])
                )
                params_to_change.pop(key)
            else:
                # leave existing parameters as they were
                # if not mentioned in the params_to_change
                for value in value_list:
                    query_params.append((key, value))
    # attach new params
    for key, value in params_to_change.items():
        query_params.append((key, value))
    query_string = context["request"].path
    if len(query_params):
        query_string += "?%s" % urllib.urlencode([
            (key, force_str(value))
            for (key, value) in query_params if value
        ]).replace("&", "&amp;")
    return query_string
```

2. Then, let's create the {% add_to_query %} template tag:  

```python
@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def add_to_query(
    context, *params_to_remove, **params_to_add
):
    """ Renders a link with modified current query
    parameters """
    query_params = []
    # go through current query params..
    for key, value_list in \
        context["request"].GET._iterlists():
        if not key in params_to_remove:
            # don't add key-value pairs which already
            # exist in the query
            if key in params_to_add and \
            unicode(params_to_add[key]) in value_list:
                params_to_add.pop(key)
            for value in value_list:
                query_params.append((key, value))
    # add the rest key-value pairs
    for key, value in params_to_add.items():
        query_params.append((key, value))
    # empty values will be removed
    query_string = context["request"].path
    if len(query_params):
        query_string += "?%s" % urllib.urlencode([
            (key, force_str(value))
            for (key, value) in query_params if value
        ]).replace("&", "&amp;")
    return query_string
```

3. Lastly, let's create the {% remove_from_query %} template tag:  

```python
@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def remove_from_query(context, *args, **kwargs):
    """ Renders a link with modified current query
    parameters """
    query_params = []
    # go through current query params..
    for key, value_list in \
        context["request"].GET._iterlists():
        # skip keys mentioned in the args
        if not key in args:
            for value in value_list:
                # skip key-value pairs mentioned in kwargs
                if not (key in kwargs and
                  unicode(value) == unicode(kwargs[key])):
                    query_params.append((key, value))
    # empty values will be removed
    query_string = context["request"].path
    if len(query_params):
        query_string = "?%s" % urllib.urlencode([
            (key, force_str(value))
            for (key, value) in query_params if value
        ]).replace("&", "&amp;")
    return query_string
```

### How it works...

All the three created template tags behave similarly. At first, they read the current query parameters from the request.GET dictionary-like QueryDict object to a new list of key value query_params tuples. Then, the values are updated depending on the positional arguments and keyword arguments. Lastly, the new query string is formed, all spaces and special characters are URL-encoded, and the ampersands connecting the query parameters are escaped. This new query string is returned to the template.  

>#### Tip
>To read more about the QueryDict objects, refer to the official Django documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/request-response/#querydict-objects.

Let's take a look at an example of how the {% modify_query %} template tag can be used. Positional arguments in the template tag define which query parameters are to be removed and the keyword arguments define which query parameters are to be modified at the current query. If the current URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/artists/?category=fine-art&page=5, we can use the following template tag to render a link that goes to the next page:  

```html
{% load utility_tags %}
<a href="{% modify_query page=6 %}">6</a>
```

The following snippet is the output rendered using the preceding template tag:  

```html
<a href="/artists/?category=fine-art&amp;page=6">6</a>
```

We can also use the following example to render a link that resets pagination and goes to another category, Sculpture, as follows:  

```html
{% load utility_tags i18n %}
<a href="{% modify_query "page" category="sculpture" %}">{% trans "Sculpture" %}</a>
```

The following snippet is the output rendered using the preceding template tag:  

```html
<a href="/artists/?category=sculpture">Sculpture</a>
```

With the {% add_to_query %} template tag, you can add the parameters step-by-step with the same name. For example, if the current URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/artists/?category=fine-art, you can add another category, Sculpture, with the help of the following link:  

```html
{% load utility_tags i18n %}
<a href="{% add_to_query "page" category="sculpture" %}">{% trans "Sculpture" %}</a>
```

This will be rendered in the template as shown in the following snippet:  

```html
<a href="/artists/?category=fine-art&amp;category=sculpture">Sculpture</a>
```

Lastly, with the help of the {% remove_from_query %} template tag, you can remove the parameters step-by-step with the same name. For example, if the current URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/artists/?category=fine-art&category=sculpture, you can remove the Sculpture category with the help of the following link:  

```html
{% load utility_tags i18n %}
<a href="{% remove_from_query "page" category="sculpture" %}"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> {% trans "Sculpture" %}</a>
```

This will be rendered in the template as follows:  

```html
<a href="/artists/?category=fine-art"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> Sculpture</a>
```
